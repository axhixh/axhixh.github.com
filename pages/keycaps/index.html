<p>List of custom keycaps for low profile  mechanical keyboards
using Kailh Choc V1 switches, PG1350.</p>

<p>Most of the keycaps in this list are 3D printed. The keycap set
works best with keyboards that have 3 rows are either ortholinear
or column staggered.</p>

<h1>Available to Purchase Choc v1 Keycaps</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4564253">MBK Choc Low Profile Keycaps</a></h2>

<p>These are keycaps designed by Max Burger. This used to be my default choice
since it is available from multiple vendors. Needs a convex 1U design
for thumbs. All convex designs are larger than 1U. I haven&rsquo;t tried the 1U
convex that <a href="https://mkultra.click/mbk-convex-pom-choc-keycaps/">MKUltra</a>
sells. Usually available in black or white. These keycaps are Choc spaced.</p>

<p>You can also get versions with legend or dyed into different colours.</p>

<p>The linked 3D print files aren&rsquo;t the original files. They are rendering
made by darryldh with permission from Max Burger.</p>

<h2><a href="https://chosfox.com/products/chocfox-cfx-choc-keycaps">Chocfox CFX</a></h2>

<p>Ergo version of MBK? The edges feel less sharp. There are no convex 1U
version for thumb keys.</p>

<h2><a href="https://lowprokb.ca/products/ldsa-low-profile-blank-keycaps">LDSA Low Profile Keycaps</a></h2>

<p>These have smooth DSA profile and molded out of PBT plastic. The best thing about these
keycaps is the 1U convex thumb keys. These keycaps are Choc spaced.</p>

<p>KBD news has an <a href="https://kbd.news/LDSA-keycap-profile-1377.html">article</a> about it.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/cs-chicago-stenographer-profile">Asymplex Chicago Stenogprapher</a></h2>

<p>These are my favourite keycaps. I love the feel of these keycaps. These are made to order
and comparatively expensive. They are made of porcelain cold cast resin and available in
many different colors. They also have convex keycaps for thumbs.</p>

<p>If you want to 3D print, the design is available at <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/158865-chicago-steno-low-profile-ergo-keycaps">https://www.printables.com/model/158865-chicago-steno-low-profile-ergo-keycaps</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/made-to-order-des_choc">Asymplex Made-to-order Choc DES</a></h2>

<p>Porcelian cold cast caps with MX spaced (19mm x 19mm). I haven&rsquo;t used these, but if
these are anything like Chicago Stenographer, I would love to used these for MX spaced
keyboards.</p>

<h2><a href="https://worklouder.cc/keycaps/">wrk. series from worklouder</a></h2>

<p>This is a whole series of black keycaps. These Choc v1 keycaps have MX spacing so are
larger 19mm x 19mm squares. There are often special editions that aren&rsquo;t black. Would work
nicely with MX spaced Choc keyboards like Corne. However, they don&rsquo;t have convex 1U
keycaps.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keycap-Switch-Profile-Keyboard-keycaps/dp/B0BCV9MN56?th=1">Kailh Keycap</a></h2>

<p>Flat, 2mm keycaps with legend. Never used this.</p>

<h2><a href="https://shop.dailycraft.jp/en/products/gravity_keycaps?variant=39972208509125">Gravity</a></h2>

<p>I have been interested in these keycaps, but never tried them. They are usually out of stock when I check.
These are 3D printed resin keycaps.</p>

<h1>Choc v1 Keycaps to 3D print</h1>

<p>There are a series of keycaps designed by Dan Schutzner, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/shoggot/designs">shoggot</a>.
Most of his designs target 3 rows keyboards. This is perfecf for someone like me who like all
keys to be 1 distance from home (#1dfh).</p>

<p>I recommend joining a whole set of keycaps for each row together to print 10 keycaps
at once. This way the whole set is like $3 instead of each keycap costing you $1.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4896661">Chicago Deep Dish</a></h2>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t used these. Was interested in these before I saw SQDG.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5163221">DCJS</a></h2>

<p>I have printed these keycaps using the 3D printing service from JLCPCB. I have printed
them in both Resin and Nylon. The whole set printed in SLA (Resin) was less than $10.
For the price these are definitely the best. While Asymblex Chicago Stenographer are
my favorite, those are more than 12 times more expensive compared to these.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5198643">SQDG</a></h2>

<p>Would love to try these. Planning to print these and try them out.
<a href="https://github.com/crides/sqdg">Crides</a> has a tweaked
version of this keycap in CadQuery.</p>

<p>I used the chocmini-whole.step from crides/sqdg Github repo to print a set
of keycaps at <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB</a>. The whole 36 keycaps set cost
$3.00 using SLA(Resin) printing and a set of 36 keycaps using SLS(Nylon)
cost $7.00.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4903358">Yeet</a></h2>

<p>Another sculpted keycap from shoggot. There are options for both Choc and MX
with either Choc or MX spacing when printing Choc keycaps.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5555215">VÃ¤rdera Kailh Choc Keycaps</a></h2>

<p>Another nice looking one that I would like to try. Looks like a lower profile
version of LDSA.</p>

<h1>Using MX Keycaps with Choc v1 Switches</h1>

<p>A possible option is to use a Choc to MX adapter and use MX keycaps. Once
such adapter is <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4134048">Choc-MX Direct Adapter by Dodger X</a>.</p>
