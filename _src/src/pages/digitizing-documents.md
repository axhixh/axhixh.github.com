I love writing with fountain pen and maintain all my notes, to dos,
logs and other lists in paper notesbooks. When I am finish a note-
book, I like to scan it and convert it into a PDF for future. It
is also easier to archive it.

OCR isn't a requirement for me at the moment.

Listing programs I have found useful for scanning and making PDFs.

## [paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless)
Full document management system, that scans, indexes and archives
all paper documents. Supports OCR and searching of documents.

## [unpaper](https://github.com/Flameeyes/unpaper)
Unpaper is a post processing program to clean scanned images. It
is used to straighten, despeckle the scanned documents. This 
program is used by paperless.

## [noteshrink](https://mzucker.github.io/2016/09/20/noteshrink.html)
Noteshrink is meant to process hand written notes. This is the
program I used to convert my scanned notebook to PDFs.

## [Office Lens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2015/04/02/office-lens-comes-to-iphone-and-android/)
Office Lens is a mobile phone app from Microsoft. This is a
great solution when I only have a few pages to scan. However,
it is too tedious to scan a whole notebook with it. I prefer
to use desktop scanner.
