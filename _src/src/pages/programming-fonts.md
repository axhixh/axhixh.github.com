# List of Fonts for Programming
Monospaced fonts for text editors, IDE, terminals and browser. I use monospaced font in my browser and override the ones from the website. Mostly free and some open source fonts. This list includes only fonts I have tried. I like thin, elongated monospace fonts.

## [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com)
Used a customized version of this font. I find it quite clean. Replaced it with Martian Mono. 

## [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/)
Love using it for terminals and browser. I constantly switch between this and Victor Mono.

## [JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/)
Using with my editor because of the number of symbols or technical Unicode characters available. Find it close enough to Iosevka.

## [Martian Mono](https://github.com/evilmartians/mono)
I love the readability of this font even when I use thin or extra light versions. 

## [Monofur](https://www.dafont.com/monofur.font)
This is different from what I usually like. However, I enjoy the rounded nature of this font.

## [Monoid](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/)
Very sharp even at small size.
 
## [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)
Another clean, thin font. Has cursive italic style for informal looks. This is my default font because of how condensed and clean it is. 

# Fonts I No Longer Use

## Cascadia Code
Font programming ligatures from Microsoft. https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code

## Fira Code
My first font with ligatures. https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode My default font till recently.

## Hasklig
Fork of Source Code Pro with programming ligatures. Ligature substitution wasn't as good as Fira Code. Ligature substituion changed, and added lots of new ligatures. https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig

## JetBrains Mono
Font from JetBrains https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/ Default font in JetBrains IDEs since 2020.1 versions. Find it too blocky compared to Fira Code.

## Source Code Pro
OpenType font from Adobe. Has extra light version. Doesn't have ligatures. https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/

## [Uiua386 Colored](https://github.com/jonathanperret/uiua386color)
Used it while I was playing with Uiua. 

### Reference
Check out [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for more fonts. These have been patched to include a large number of glyphs for use in terminals, editors etc.
