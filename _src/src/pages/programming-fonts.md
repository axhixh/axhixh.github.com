# List of Fonts for Programming
Monospaced fonts for text editors, IDE and terminals. Mostly free and some open source fonts. Only fonts I have tried.

## Cascadia Code
Font programming ligatures from Microsoft. https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code

## Fira Code
My first font with ligatures. https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode My default font till recently.

## JetBrains Mono
Font from JetBrains https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/ Default font in JetBrains IDEs since 2020.1 versions. Find it too blocky compared to Fira Code.

## Monoid
Very sharp even at small size https://larsenwork.com/monoid/

## Source Code Pro
OpenType font from Adobe. Has extra light version. Doesn't have ligatures. https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/

## Hasklig
Fork of Source Code Pro with programming ligatures. Ligature substitution wasn't as good as Fira Code. My new default font since ligature substituion changed, and added lots of new ligatures. https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig
