# List of Fonts for Programming
Monospaced fonts for text editors, IDE and terminals. Mostly free and some open source fonts. Only fonts I have tried.

## Cascadia Code
Font programming ligatures from Microsoft. https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code

## Commit Mono
Used a customized version of this font. I find it quite clean. Replaced it with Martian Mono. https://commitmono.com

## Fira Code
My first font with ligatures. https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode My default font till recently.

## Hasklig
Fork of Source Code Pro with programming ligatures. Ligature substitution wasn't as good as Fira Code. Ligature substituion changed, and added lots of new ligatures. https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig

## JetBrains Mono
Font from JetBrains https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/ Default font in JetBrains IDEs since 2020.1 versions. Find it too blocky compared to Fira Code.

## Martian Mono
I love the readability of this font even when I use thin or extra light versions. https://github.com/evilmartians/mono

## Monoid
Very sharp even at small size https://larsenwork.com/monoid/

## Source Code Pro
OpenType font from Adobe. Has extra light version. Doesn't have ligatures. https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/

## Victor Mono
Another clean, thin font. Has cursive italic style for informal looks. Currently my default because of how condensed and clean it is. https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/
