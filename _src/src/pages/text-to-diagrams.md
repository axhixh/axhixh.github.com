I prefer to use text to diagram tools because it is easier to
version control the diagrams and see the difference between them.

It is easier to describe in text than spend time drawing them and
then laying them out. Auto-layout is often a time saver for these.

List of tools for creating diagrams from text descriptions.

## [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
Includes all the common UML diagrams. I like that I can make the
diagrams "handwritten". It is useful to indicate they represent
draft diagrams.

## [Mermaid](http://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)
Looks good. I haven't used it much. Easy to get started without
installing anything.

## [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)  
Generate cloud architecture diagrams from description written as
Python code description. Supports major cloud providers and Kubernetes.

## [D2](https://d2lang.com/tour/intro/)
D2, Declarative Diagramming, is new language for text to diagram.
It has a multiple layout engines and extensions. The diagrams it
generates are very clean. The language is readable.

Alternatives to PlantUML that looks interesting are:

 1. [Nomnoml](http://www.nomnoml.com/)
 2. [ZenUML](https://zenuml.com)

[Text to Diagram](https://text-to-diagram.com) website has a nice list
of diagramming tools that you can compare.
