A memorable explanation of SQL joins that I read somewhere on Internet. Hacker News or Reddit comments? 

I was taught the Puritan church model for joins. It’s a little corny and maybe hasn’t aged particularly well, but gets the job done. It goes something like this:
Imagine a Puritan church where the men sit on one side, the women on the other.

An `INNER JOIN` is when the married couples hold hands and leave at the end, leaving all the singles behind.

A `LEFT JOIN` is when the women all leave - the married ones take their husbands and the single women go alone.

A `RIGHT JOIN` is the same thing, except the men all leave and take the wives and leave the single women behind. It’s rude to do this, in a Puritan church and in your SQL.

A `FULL OUTER JOIN` is a fire drill and everyone leaves, married couples together.

And a `CROSS JOIN` is a swingers party and should never happen in a Puritan church nor your SQL.
