Clients I have used for interacting with `git` when I need something more than the command line interface or the built-in UI `git gui`.

# [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

 First git GUI I used. I still use it because I am familiar with it. You need to get an Atlassian account to use it.

# [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

 Nice git GUI. Find it faster than SourceTree. Don't need to create any sort of accounts. Having built-in image diff is nice.

# [Tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/)

  Even though it is a text-mode interface, it is nice to be able to scroll around to explore a git repository. I have a shell alias `alias incoming='tig ..origin/master'` to explore incoming git changes.

# [Lazy Git](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

  Text-mode interface for use in a terminal. Comparatively complete UI.
