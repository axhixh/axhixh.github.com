Clients I have used for interacting with `git` when I need something more than the command line interface or the built-in UI `git gui`.

# [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

 First git GUI I used. I used it for a long time because I am familiar with it. You need to get an Atlassian account to use it.

# [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

 Nice git GUI. Find it faster than SourceTree. Don't need to create any sort of accounts. Having built-in image diff is nice.

# [Tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/)

Even though it is a text-mode interface, it is nice to be able to scroll around to explore a git repository. I have a shell alias `alias incoming='tig ..origin/master'` to explore incoming git changes. I frequently use it to explore when I am in the terminal.

# [Lazy Git](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

Text-mode interface for use in a terminal. Comparatively complete UI.

# [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com)

Currently, this is my go to client and I rarely use the CLI. I now use its workflow and virtual
branches. It allows me to apply/unapply multiple branches and create pull requests with subset
of changes as necessary.
