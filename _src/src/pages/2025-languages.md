I enjoy exploring programming languages. This is a list of languages I hope to focus on during 2025 and languages I will not spend time on no matter how tempting they look.

# Languages I Will Use

## [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)

It is my primary language at work. Use it to write backend code on the JVM. Makes coding for JVM acceptable.

## [Standard ML](https://smlfamily.github.io)

Will not start anything new, but complete my on-going projects and specially the interpreter/compiler I am writing for [Monkey in Standard ML](https://github.com/axhixh/monkey).

## [Julia](https://julialang.org)

Planning to use Julia for all my data analysis work. Pluto notebooks and rich statistics and visualization libraries make this a practical language. I don't know Julia so it is prefect execuse to learn. This is also a way to explore array languages.

## [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)

Can't really avoid it since it used for configuring so many of the tools I use from my terminal, [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), to [Typst](https://typst.app) that I use for creating documents.

## [OCaml](https://ocaml.org)

Planning to use OCaml as the primary language for my personal projects this year. Haven't built anything large with it. Hopefully, by making it my primary language I will use it for something more than one-offs.

# Languages I Will Skip (for 2025)

This are languages I find fun and interesting. I plan to avoid these for 2025 and not be distracted by them.

## [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html)

Ever since I found Koka, I have been fascinated by it. It is the language I have enjoyed writing code in the most. I would love to explore effect types and effect handlers.

## [Flix](https://flix.dev)

I had seen Flix before, but wasn't excited with it since I didn't understand the value it brought. Since learning about effects and effect handlers with Koka, I find Flix interesting. It is certainly more mature than Koka and I can start building production ready software with it. It is on the JVM so has access to lots of libraries, but I am not excited because it is on the JVM.

## [Roc](https://roc-lang.org)

On paper, this could be the language I would love to write in. I am fascinated by the idea of platforms. However, like Koka it isn't ready yet. Learning about this language is how I ended up with Koka and if both were ready, I think I would choose Koka over this.

## [Gleam](https://gleam.run)

This is the language I wanted to code in to explore Erlang ecosystem and BEAM, Erlang's virtual machine. It is similar to most ML languages and is production ready.

## [Uiua](https://uiua.org)

It is an array programming language. I wanted to explore array languages. There are so many things I want to explore using this language - array programming, tacit programming using stack, combinatory logic and really see if combination of these with notation changes the way I think.

I have done some advent of code exercises with it. Also want to compare it with [BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) which I found when I started exploring Uiua.
