Over the years, I have hand code and used a basic script to generate
my personal website. The last few years, I have used a [Clojure script][1]
I wrote to create the photo albums. This worked well for me.

This year, I have decided to do more with my corner of the web. I want to
use as a notebook and store links, lists and other random stuff.

Initially, I hosted the site on a [SheevaPlug][2], and now I host it with
[Github Pages][3]. This means it is a static website.
